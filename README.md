# Agri-food emissions and temperature changes - Ironhack Final Project

## Introduction
This project was prepared as a final project for Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp. 

**The objective** was to analyse the dataset, create a dashboard which will allow the users to explore the data and to create a machine learning models predicting a target variable: average temperature change.

This repository was created in order to present the results of my work and it consists of: 

1. **Files folder** - containt the dataset used in the analysis. 
2. **Python code** - Jupyter Notebook file containing Python code with machine learning models
3. **A Dashboard** - Tableau dashboard was built to allow an easy navigation through the main findings. It offers geographic filtering (using the map) and Year filter. 
4. **Presentation** - slides used during the final presentation of the project. 

## Dataset
The dataset was created based on the multiple datasets from FAO and IPCC and provides the information about emissions from agri-food industry between 1990 and 2020. The original dataset used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrolobello/agri-food-co2-emission-dataset-forecasting-ml/data.

- Total Population - Male: Total number of male individuals in the population.
- Total Population - Female: Total number of female individuals in the population.
- total_emission: Total greenhouse gas emissions from various sources.
- Average Temperature Â°C: The average increasing of temperature (by year) in degrees Celsius



## Data analysis
Data analysis was done in Jupyter Notebook (Python) and through plots in Tableau.

In order to understand the correlations among the features I applied **Variance Inflation Factor** analysis and **Principal Component Analysis**.

## Machine learning models
Searching for the best performing model I tried 5 regression models as well as time series forecasting using Prophet.
